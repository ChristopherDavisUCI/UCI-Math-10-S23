(Ask William or Chris if you need a new invitation; the invitations do eventually expire.)\n* Find 1-2 other students to work with. (To get full credit on this assignment, you need to work with at least one other student.  This group is just for this assignment.)\n* One student in your group should create a new workspace:\n1.  Click the arrow next to your name at the top left.\n2.  Click the plus icon next to your email address.\n3.  Select \"Free for students and teachers\" at the bottom center.\n4.  Select \"Education plan\".\n5.  Name the workspace something like \"Week 0 group\".\n6.  Once the workspace is created, invite your other group members to your workspace (click on \"Setting & members\" on the left) and give them \"Editor\" (rather than \"Viewer\") access.  \n7.
