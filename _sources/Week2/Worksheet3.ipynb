(Hint.  If `s` is a string, then `s[-2:]` represents the last two characters, and `s[:-2]` represents everything but the last two characters.  Notice that there are no dates in the \"Date\" column from before 1960, so if something like \"1/1/10\" appears, you can be sure that it stands for 2010 and not 1910.

If you want to have a Python string that includes multiple lines, you can use triple apostrophes, like `'''Here could be a string with line breaks'''`.  Use Boolean indexing to get the corresponding sub-DataFrame (later we'll see how to do the same thing using `groupby`, but it's important to be able to also do this directly using Boolean indexing).  Be sure to include the day of the week, the full name of the stock exchange, and the number of rows.
