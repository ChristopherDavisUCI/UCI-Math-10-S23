    "* Scores were again high, median of 82%.  Good job!  Again there won't be any curving.\n",
    "* No lecture planned today.  Time to work on the course project.  Yufei, Hanson, and I are here to answer questions.\n",
    "* I plan to have an office hour on Wednesday from 2-3pm in ALP 3610 (during our scheduled final exam time).  I will send a Canvas message to the class when it's confirmed."
