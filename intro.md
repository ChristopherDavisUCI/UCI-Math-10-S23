**Introduction to Programming for Data Science**

**About the class**.  The goal of this course is to introduce programming in Python, with an emphasis on some of the tools that are most relevant to *data science*.  There are two primary parts of the course:
* Part 1.  Exploratory Data Analysis
* Part 2.  Introduction to Machine Learning


**Learning Outcomes**.  The primary learning outcomes for Math 10 are that students will be able to:
* select appropriate data types (both built-in Python types as well as types defined in external libraries) when performing computations;
* write code which is *Pythonic* (for example, avoiding unnecessary for loops) and adheres to the *DRY* (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle;
* manipulate structured data using NumPy and pandas;
* given unfamiliar data, use techniques specific to the pandas library to gain a deeper understanding of the data;
* produce interactive visualizations conveying significant aspects of datasets using Altair;
* select a suitable machine learning algorithm for a given task and implement it using scikit-learn;
* assess the performance of a machine learning algorithm using a loss function;
* recognize the potential for overfitting when evaluating a machine learning algorithm, and how to detect overfitting using a test set;
* write a data-focused Deepnote notebook using a combination of code cells and explanatory markdown cells.
